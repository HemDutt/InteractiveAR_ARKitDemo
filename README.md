## Overview

Augmented reality (AR) offers new ways for users to interact with real and virtual 3D content in your app. This project shows ways to apply Horizontal plane identification and interacting with 3D model to easily create immersive, intuitive AR experiences.

## Getting Started

ARKit and this sample app require iOS 11 and a device with an A9 (or later) processor. ARKit is not available in iOS Simulator.

## Identifying Horizontal planes

**Help people to locate a surface and place an object on it.**
In this demo application identify a horizonatal surface and provide an anchor to a 3D model.

## User Interaction with Virtual Objects

**Allow people to directly interact with virtual objects using touch event.**
The 3D model used is downlaoded from templates of https://www.mixamo.com
Touch on the model starts animation on the 3D model and another tap on the model stops the  animation.
